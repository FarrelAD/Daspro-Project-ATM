## Overview üöÄ
**"Daspro-Project-ATM"** is a project of making ATM (Automated Teller Machine) mechanism based on CLI (Command Line Interface). Daspro is stand for "Dasar Pemrograman" or basic programming in English. The goal of this project is how we can implement the concept of how a machine work like ATM into a programming. So we can really understand the workflow of a machine and try to think as a computer. In here, we use Java as the one and only programming language. 

> This project was done in the first semester at Informatics Politeknik Negeri Malang with the guidance of our beloved lecturers, Mrs. Triana Fatmawati ‚ô•Ô∏è

## Timeline Work üìÖ
- START: 4 September 2023
- FINISH: 22 December 2023

We did this project incrementally. Whenever we learn something new in programming, we immediately implement it into our project. With new material introduced weekly, our project advances in complexity week by week.

All fun and challenges we've done while making this project. We always do learn something new and helping each other. So that, we can succeed this project. ‚úä

## Tools

| Name | Function |
|------|----------|
| <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java"> | Programming language. Without this, our project is nothing |
| <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode"> | Main text editor. Mostly we use this for coding until the project was done|
| <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=sublime"> | Secondary text editor. [Farrel](https://github.com/FarrelAD) sometimes use this because it's lightweight |
